Stealth Typer is a VSCode Extension designed to hide your text in the editor by setting the text color to match the background color. This makes the text invisible, allowing you to type comfortably in public places without worrying about someone peeking at your screen.

To use Stealth Typer, press `Cmd+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette, then type and run the "Toggle Stealth Typing" command. You can also bind this function to a custom keyboard shortcut for convenience.

If you want to view the content you've typed, simply select all in the editor.

To optimize your Stealth Typing experience, we recommend turning on the 'Highlight Current Line' feature and turning off 'Spell Check' when Stealth Typing is active.
